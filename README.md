A simple blue-themed Tkinter to-do application.

# Introduction

**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹

This is my first solo project and my first time practicing using Tkinter.

My goal was to be able to be able to create a simple to-do application that allows users to:
- Create tasks with titles and descriptions
- Have multiple tasks that users can scroll through, inspect (view their descriptions), complete, and delete
- Be able to track their task progress
- And most importantly, view periodically changing, random motivational messages :)

My other goal was to play around with markdown and create proper documentation for current and future projects!
